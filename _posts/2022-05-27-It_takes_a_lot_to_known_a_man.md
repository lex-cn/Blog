## It takes a lot to know a man

[Verse 1]                                              \
It takes a lot to know a man                           \
It takes a lot to understand                           \
The warrior, the sage                                  \
The little boy enraged                                 \
It takes a lot to know a woman                         \
A lot to understand what's humming                     \
The honey-bee, the sting                               \
The little girl with wings                             \
                                                       \
[Chorus]                                               \
It takes a lot to give                                 \
To ask for help                                        \
To be yourself                                         \
To know and love what you live with                    \
It takes a lot to breathe                              \
To touch, to feel                                      \
The slow reveal                                        \
Of what another body needs                             \
                                                       \
[Verse 2]                                              \
It takes a lot to know a man                           \
A lot to know, to understand                           \
The father and the son                                 \
The hunter and the gun                                 \
It takes a lot to know a woman                         \
A lot to comprehend what's coming                      \
The mother and the child                               \
The muse and the beguiled                              \
                                                       \
[Chorus]                                               \
It takes a lot to give                                 \
To ask for help                                        \
To be yourself                                         \
To know and love what you live with                    \
It takes a lot to breathe                              \
To touch, to feel                                      \
The slow reveal                                        \
Of what another body needs                             \
It takes a lot to give                                 \

[Bridge]                                               \
What are you so afraid to lose?                        \
What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do? \
What are you so afraid to lose?                        \

You're nervous and you're sorry)                       \
What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do? \
(Crying like a baby                                    \
Saying, "this thing is killing me")                    \

(Killing me)
