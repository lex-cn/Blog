# How you define ture success

If you get to be 65 or 70 and later, and the people that you want to have love you actually do love you, you're a sucess.

By far the best investment you can make is in yourself. If they just learn to communicate better and both in writing and person, they increase their value at least 50%.

If you invest in yourself, nobody can take it away from you.

You get exactly one mind and one body in this world, and you cann't start taking care of it when you're 50. By that time, you'll rust it out, if you haven't done anything.

You want to associate with people who is better than you're. You get choices as
you go down the line, and who you admire, who you want to copy.
